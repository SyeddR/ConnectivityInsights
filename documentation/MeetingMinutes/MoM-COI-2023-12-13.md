## Issues
Open:
- [#6](https://github.com/camaraproject/ConnectivityInsights/issues/6)  API basepath should be human-readable
  
  This is awaiting confirmation from Herbert that his requested changes are reflected
  
- [#9](https://github.com/camaraproject/ConnectivityInsights/issues/9) Performance metric definitions do not match those of the QoD API
  
  Agreement to adopt the QoD schema.

## Discussions
- Completed actions were confirmed:
  
    DONE Mahesh to mail the mailing list with call details and update time on GitHub
  
    DONE Kevin to add Connectivity Insights to CAMARA Wiki

- Discussion on whether we need for port identification at both Device and Application port side

    Agreed we would need this for Connectivity Insights between a given device and application server.  
    The device IPv4 address and public port can be sent by the API consumer, but we will not need to user the private port (pre-NAT) in the API.
    The schema deifintions will be reused from QoD.
    
- Issues: see discussion and resolution in 'Issues' section above.

## Actions
Open:
1. Mahesh to align the Connectivity Insights API spec with commonalities guidelines.
   - Mahesh will add documentation (similar to QoD) and is going through the API Design Guidelines to align
   - Response codes will be adopted from QoD
   - we will add cloud notifications in a later release (for now focus is the main API Design guidelines)

2. Kevin to clarify if a need for consent (or a check for consent-needed) is determined by the sub-project or other body in CAMARA.
