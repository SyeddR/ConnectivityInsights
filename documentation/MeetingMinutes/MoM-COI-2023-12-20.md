    Guidance from commonalities is to include a security component but with an empty scope until this is clarified.

- Question: can megalinter be run outside Github (as a precheck)?

- Labels added to issues and PRs: 0-2-0-wip and 0-3-0-wip. These indicate the target version for the issue/PR (i.e. 'this issue is intended to be fixed in 0-3-0-wip', 'this PR is to create the 0-3-0-wip version'
